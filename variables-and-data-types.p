# Let's start with a long time programming tradition and print "Hello World!" by typing it inside print() function. Replace "type here" with "Hello World!"

print("type here")

# Now try to assign "Hello World!" to the variable my_text. You can assign "Hello World!" to the variable below on.

my_text=""
print(my_text)

# There are many ways to concatenate different data pieces with Python's print() function. Here is one of them. Take a look! # Type a couple of different values inside the print function. Make sure they are separated by commas. 
   
print("")

# Below is a good example of mixing numbers and text inside the print() function. Assign a number to the variable: glass_of_water

glass_of_water=
print("I drank", glass_of_water, "glasses of water today.")

# Let's try to see what happens after assigning a new value to our variable. Place the variable: glass_of_water inside the print function and observe what happens.

glass_of_water=3
glass_of_water=glass_of_water + 1
print()

# Let's check out a simple integer example. Assign an integer to the variable, then print it.

men_stepped_on_the_moon=
print()

# Now a string example. Type a couple of words or a short sentence for your variable, then print it.

my_reason_for_coding=
print()

# Let's try to see what happens after assigning a new value to our variable. Assign a float with 2 decimals to the variable below. 

global_mean_sea_level_2018=21

#Type your code here.
global_mean_sea_level_2018=
print(global_mean_sea_level_2018)

# Finally a boolean example. Assign True or False to the variable below then print it.

staying_alive=
print(staying_alive)

# Let's check out some exercises that will help you really understand the type() function and type conversions in Python. Using the type() function, assign the type of the variable to answer_1, then print it. 

men_stepped_on_the_moon=12

#Type your code here.
answer_1=
print(answer_1)

# Using the type() function, assign the type of the variable to answer_2, then print it.

my_reason_for_coding="intergalactic travel"

#Type your code here.
answer_2=
print(answer_2)

# Using the type() function, assign the type of the variable to answer_3, then print it.

global_mean_sea_level_delta_2018=21.36

#Type your code here.
answer_3=
print(answer_3)

# We will now print the type of boolean data. Later stages in programming, booleans become quite common. 

staying_alive=True

#Type your code here.
answer_4=
print(answer_4)

# Now let's see some more exercises about converting data types. Let's now try to convert a string into an integer. my_grade variable is a string (because it's in quotes). Convert it to an integer.

my_grade="10"
answer_5=
print(answer_5)

# Can you convert a float into an integer. my_temp variable is a float (because it has decimals). Convert it to an integer.

my_temp=97.70
answer_6=
print(answer_6)

# Now let's convert a string into a float. shoe_price variable is a string (because it's in quotes). On line 9, convert it into a float.

shoe_price="69.99"
answer_7=
print(answer_7)

# Finally, convert data into a string. GWP denotes the total economic activity created by the world population collectively in a year.

gross_world_product=84.84
gwp_str=
answer_8="In 2018 gross product of the world (GWP) was " + gwp_str + " in trillion US dollars."
print(answer_8)

# Let's create an empty list and print its type.

gift_list=
answer_9=
print(answer_9)

# Now, we will create an empty dictionary and print its type.

grocery_items=
answer_10=
print(answer_10)

# Then we will create an empty tuple and print its type.

bucket_list=
answer_11=
print(answer_11)

# Now let's see some more exercises about converting data types. Let's create a list with values in it.

gift_list=
print(gift_list)

# Now let's create a dictionary with values in it.

grocery_list=
print(grocery_list)

# Finally, let's create a tuple with values in it. 

bucket_list=
print(bucket_list)
